# Welcome to my personal (_experimental version_) blog

I'm fascinated about web development.
I use this blog to learn in public, by describing the projects I'm currently building and presenting my own studying notes. 
Currently, I'm focused in front-end technologies, specially React.js and Vue.js.

I'm also a big fan of procedural and generative art, which I plan to bring into this blog sometime in the future.

[Click here](/projects/) to access the projects I am currently working on.
